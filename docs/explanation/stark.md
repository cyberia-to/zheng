# stark

Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge. a proof system where a prover convinces a verifier that a computation was performed correctly — transparent setup, post-quantum security, hash-only assumption.

Ben-Sasson, Bentov, Horesh, Riabzev (2018). the foundation of verifiable computation in [[cyber]], [[Ethereum]] L2s (StarkNet, Polygon), and [[Celestia]].

## properties

| property | value |
|---|---|
| trusted setup | none (transparent) |
| post-quantum | yes (hash-only security) |
| proof size | 60–200 KB |
| prover | quasi-linear O(n log n) |
| verifier | polylogarithmic O(log² n) |
| security assumption | collision-resistant hash function |

## arithmetization

a stark proves that a computation satisfies algebraic constraints. the mapping from computation to constraints is called arithmetization. three major constraint systems:

### AIR — Algebraic Intermediate Representation

the native arithmetization for starks. represents computation as a matrix (the execution trace) plus polynomial constraints.

```
EXECUTION TRACE
  matrix: rows = time steps, columns = registers
  example: VM with 16 registers, 1024 steps → 1024 × 16 matrix

TRANSITION CONSTRAINTS
  polynomials relating consecutive rows:
  "column[3] at row t+1 = column[1] at row t × column[2] at row t"
  enforces: each instruction executed correctly

BOUNDARY CONSTRAINTS
  specific values at specific positions:
  "column[0] at row 0 = program_input"
  "column[0] at last row = program_output"
```

AIR constraints can have any degree (commonly 2–8). used by StarkWare/CAIRO, ethstark, Winterfell, Miden, [[cyber]].

### R1CS — Rank-1 Constraint System

the native arithmetization for [[SNARKs]]. each constraint has the form `(a · w) × (b · w) = (c · w)` where w is the witness vector and a, b, c are coefficient vectors. degree-2 only. used by Groth16, Spartan, Nova. natural for arithmetic circuits, less natural for sequential VM execution.

### CCS — Customizable Constraint Systems

generalizes R1CS, Plonkish (PLONK/Halo2), and AIR into one framework. Setty, Thaler, Wahby (2023). see [[CCS]].

```
CCS instance: (M₁, ..., M_t, S₁, ..., S_q, c₁, ..., c_q)

constraint:  Σⱼ cⱼ · ∏_{i ∈ Sⱼ} Mᵢ · z = 0

special cases:
  R1CS:     t=3, q=2, c₁=1, c₂=-1        → degree 2
  Plonkish: selector polynomials → M        → custom gates
  AIR:      shifted rows → M                → transition constraints
```

a proof system handling CCS handles all three — including AIR. [[SuperSpartan]] is this proof system.

## univariate vs multilinear

### univariate starks (classical, 2018)

the original construction. each trace column is interpolated into a univariate polynomial, constraints are checked via polynomial composition and division by a zerofier (vanishing polynomial), and [[FRI]] proves the quotient has bounded degree.

```
pipeline:
  1. execution → trace (N rows × M columns)
  2. interpolate each column → M univariate polynomials of degree N
  3. compose with constraint polynomials
  4. divide by zerofier Z(x) where Z vanishes on the trace domain
  5. FRI low-degree test: quotient Q(x) has degree ≤ d
  6. M commitments, M openings
```

the prover requires FFT/NTT for interpolation — O(N log N) per column. the verifier checks M separate polynomial openings. used by StarkWare/CAIRO, ethstark, early Polygon zkEVM.

### multilinear starks (modern, 2023–2025)

the entire execution trace becomes one multilinear polynomial. constraints are verified via the [[sumcheck]] protocol. Brakedown (as a multilinear PCS) opens the commitment at the single point that sumcheck reduces to.

```
pipeline:
  1. execution → trace (2ⁿ rows × 2ᵐ columns)
  2. encode entire trace as ONE multilinear polynomial f(x₁, ..., x_{n+m})
     row index encoded in n boolean variables
     column index encoded in m boolean variables
     each variable has degree ≤ 1
  3. express constraints as CCS (AIR maps directly)
  4. sumcheck reduces ALL constraint checks to ONE evaluation at ONE random point r
  5. Brakedown opens f(r) — one commitment, one opening
```

a multilinear polynomial in k variables:
```
f(x₁, ..., x_k) = Σ_{S ⊆ {1,...,k}} c_S · ∏_{i ∈ S} xᵢ

every variable appears with degree at most 1
example: f(x,y,z) = 3xy + 2xz + yz + x + 5
```

| property | univariate | multilinear |
|---|---|---|
| commitments | M (one per column) | 1 (entire trace) |
| openings | M | 1 |
| constraint prover | O(N log N) per column (FFT) | O(N) total (field ops only) |
| constraint verifier | check M quotients | check sumcheck + 1 evaluation |
| trace representation | unnatural (polynomial interpolation) | natural (boolean hypercube) |
