# Zheng audits

Source reviews and validation evidence live here. Protocol contracts are
defined in [specs](../specs/README.md).

- [Direct execution review](direct-execution-review.md) — soundness findings, obligations and implemented checks.
- [Public execution validation](public-execution.md) — tested relation, adversarial checks, CLI measurements and remaining gates.
- [zk profile, state binding and verifying keys, 2026-10](zk-profile-2026-10.md) — veil (succinct zk) against MPC-in-the-head, state evidence inside zheng, cached keys; raw numbers.
- [Accumulation and the nox machine, 2026-10](accumulation-2026-10.md) — phase 3: step relation, accumulation, measurements against the gates, what is not done.
- [Recursion (IVC over the nox machine), 2026-10](recursion-2026-10.md) — the step relation verifies the previous step in-circuit: constant 282–285 KB from 33 cycles to 1.57M cycles, bit-flip scan, gaps to 64 KB / 1 ms.
- [Recursion adversarial review, 2026-10](recursion-review-2026-10.md) — PR #53 attacked: one hole (an extension value in a base slot unbound the final state from the last public input; fixed), circuit cell scan, live flag, binding, deferred claims, ledger recomputed.
