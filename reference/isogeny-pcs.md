# isogeny PCS

the F_q PCS backend for [[zheng]]. dedicated polynomial commitment over [[genies]]'s isogeny field F_q where q = 4·ℓ₁·ℓ₂·...·ℓₙ - 1. privacy primitives (stealth addresses, VDF verification, blind signatures, ring signatures) prove natively in their own field — no non-native arithmetic penalty.

implements the [[pcs|PCS]] trait for F_q. the IOP layer ([[SuperSpartan]] + [[sumcheck]] + [[HyperNova]]) stays field-generic. only the polynomial commitment scheme changes. [[hemera]] remains the only hash.

## architecture

```
zheng
├── IOP:          SuperSpartan + sumcheck     (field-generic, shared)
├── Composition:  HyperNova folding           (field-generic, shared)
├── Hash:         hemera                      (one hash, universal)
├── PCS₁:         Brakedown (Goldilocks)      (arithmetic workloads)
├── PCS₂:         Binius (F₂ tower)           (binary workloads)
├── PCS₃:         Ring-aware (R_q)            (FHE/lattice workloads)
├── PCS₄:         Isogeny (F_q)              (privacy workloads)
└── PCS₅:         Tropical (min,+)           (optimization workloads)
```

zheng exposes a PCS trait. all four backends implement it:

```
trait PCS<F: Field> {
    fn commit(poly: &MultilinearPoly<F>) -> Commitment;
    fn open(poly: &MultilinearPoly<F>, point: &[F]) -> Opening;
    fn verify(commitment: &Commitment, point: &[F], value: F, proof: &Opening) -> bool;
}
```

## why dedicated PCS, not non-native

genies uses primes q that may be 512-bit or larger (CSIDH-512: 512-bit prime). encoding F_q operations as F_p constraints costs (512/64)² = 64× per operation. a single isogeny walk involves thousands of F_q operations. 64× × thousands = unacceptable.

dedicated PCS₄ over F_q: each F_q operation = 1 constraint. same approach as Binius for F₂ — match the PCS to the algebra.

| approach | cost per F_q mul | isogeny walk (1000 muls) |
|----------|-----------------|------------------------|
| non-native in F_p | ~64 F_p constraints | ~64,000 constraints |
| dedicated PCS₄ | 1 F_q constraint | ~1,000 constraints |

## F_q field structure

```
q = 4 · ℓ₁ · ℓ₂ · ... · ℓₙ - 1

  ℓᵢ: small distinct primes (for efficient isogeny computation)
  q ≡ 3 (mod 4): enables supersingular curve y² = x³ + x over F_q

CSIDH parameter sets:
  CSIDH-512:   q = 512-bit prime, 74 small primes ℓᵢ
  CSIDH-1024:  q = 1024-bit prime
  CSIDH-2048:  q = 2048-bit prime
```

F_q elements are multi-limb integers (8-32 Goldilocks-sized limbs). arithmetic uses Montgomery multiplication.

## commitment

Brakedown instantiated over F_q instead of F_p. same expander-graph linear code construction, different field:

```
commit(poly over F_q):
  1. encode evaluations via expander-graph linear code over F_q
  2. build hemera Merkle tree over encoded rows
     (hemera hashes bytes — field element serialization is transparent)
  3. root = hemera hash (same 32-byte format as all PCS backends)
```

hemera operates on byte sequences. F_q elements serialize to bytes. same Merkle tree, same commitment format, same Fiat-Shamir transcript.

## opening and verification

same Brakedown tensor decomposition protocol, over F_q:

```
open(poly, point):
  tensor decompose point into F_q vectors
  compute inner products over F_q
  recursive opening: O(log N + λ) F_q operations

verify(commitment, point, value, proof):
  check tensor consistency (F_q arithmetic)
  check Merkle auth paths (hemera)
  ~660 F_q field ops (same count as Brakedown over F_p)
```

## cost comparison

| operation | F_p (Brakedown) | F_q (Isogeny PCS) | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| F_p multiply | 1 constraint | N/A | nebu workload |
| F_q multiply | ~64 constraints (non-native) | 1 constraint | genies workload |
| isogeny walk step | ~64 constraints (non-native) | 1 constraint | privacy primitive |
| hemera hash | ~736 constraints | ~736 constraints | same (hemera is F_p native) |
| VDF verification | ~64K constraints (non-native) | ~1K constraints | delay primitive |

## primary workloads

| workload | what it proves | constraints |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| stealth key exchange | isogeny walk correctness | ~1000 F_q |
| VDF verification | sequential squaring proof | ~1000 F_q |
| blind signatures | group action on blinded message | ~500 F_q |
| ring signatures | one-of-n group action proof | ~2000 F_q |
| VRF | deterministic randomness from group action | ~500 F_q |

## cross-algebra composition

genies sub-traces fold into the shared F_p accumulator via HyperNova:

```
nox<F_q> sub-trace → zheng<Isogeny PCS> proof
                           ↓
            HyperNova fold into shared F_p accumulator
            cost: ~766 F_p constraints per boundary crossing
```

universal CCS with selectors:

```
universal_ccs = {
  sel_Fp:   1 for Goldilocks rows, 0 otherwise
  sel_F2:   1 for binary rows, 0 otherwise
  sel_ring: 1 for ring-structured rows, 0 otherwise
  sel_Fq:   1 for isogeny rows, 0 otherwise
}
```

one accumulator covers all four algebras. the decider runs once in F_p.

## recursion boundary

isogeny proofs are NOT verified inside F_q circuits. verification crosses to Goldilocks:

```
isogeny execution → isogeny proof (hemera Merkle + FS externally)
                        ↓
    verify in F_p circuit (hemera native, ~736 constraints)
                        ↓
    fold into F_p accumulator
```

hemera inside F_q circuit: prohibitively expensive (simulating Goldilocks in F_q). hemera inside F_p circuit: ~736 constraints. recursion boundary is always Goldilocks.

## genies dependency

a separate repo **genies** provides F_q arithmetic:
- multi-limb integer arithmetic (Montgomery multiplication)
- supersingular curve operations over F_q
- class group action computation (isogeny walks)
- no hemera dependency, no nebu dependency
- pure isogeny field algebra

zheng depends on genies for the Isogeny PCS backend. hemera remains the only hash throughout.

## open questions

1. **F_q element size**: CSIDH-512 uses 512-bit field elements (8 × 64-bit limbs). optimal limb representation for Brakedown tensor decomposition
2. **expander graph over F_q**: Brakedown expander construction generalized to multi-limb fields — concrete expansion parameters
3. **proof size**: Brakedown over F_q produces larger proofs (field elements are bigger). target: < 10 KiB per isogeny proof
4. **cross-field soundness**: HyperNova folding F_p and F_q instances into same accumulator — security reduction
